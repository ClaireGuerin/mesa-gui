# connects the model and the view to make the application work. 
# User events (or requests) are sent to the controller, which puts the model to work. 
# When the model delivers the requested result (or data) in the right format, the controller forwards it to the view. 
# Here, the controller will receive from the GUI: model selection, edited code and ask the web view to update accordingly.
